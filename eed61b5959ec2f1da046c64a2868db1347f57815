      "message": "Dexpreopt would only affect first installs, yes.\n\nFor those, the files are stored in the \"system_other\" partition, which is read to make first boot not too slow.\n\nFor updates, installation does dexopting for all apps. Not sure if that\u0027d handle apex, though. However, dexopt during update install is what makes it take so long to install, and thus also scales with the number of apps installed.",
