The strings have embedded labels; is it possible to define these types of strings directly?

      "message": "Any ideas welcome, but this remains low priority of course.\n\nI got errors for the strings when compiling using `@android` so took a hint from elsewhere in `vendor/calyx` and wrote `?android` instead, which was likely a mistake, because currently nothing is working at all. No badges for icons, no customized strings when tapping icons in Overview, nothing â€” obviously a major regression from AOSP since differentiating main user apps from profile apps is impossible at a glance.",
