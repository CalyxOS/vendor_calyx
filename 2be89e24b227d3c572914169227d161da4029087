      "message": "I think the committing can be easily automated once the prebuilts/calyx/fdroid Makefiles are properly quoted and can handle any file name.  Then fdroid-repo-setupwizard can just rsync the whole state, generate the Makefiles, and commit everything.  That does mean that the .gitignore needs to be maintained, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s much work.",
