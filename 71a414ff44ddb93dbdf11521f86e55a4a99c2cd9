      "message": "Ack, you are right, by now I totally forgot it has 2nd Work and 3rd Work already (even though I mention it in the commit message). So, yes, if you only have 3 profiles, there isn\u0027t strictly any accessibility issue solved by this, and 3 is the max we are considering allowing right now. Customizing the work profile name (which can easily be done with Shelter and/or Insular already) could make it easier to distinguish than remembering Work vs 2nd Work vs 3rd Work, but that\u0027s the only benefit.\n\nAre there some other issues you\u0027ve thought of re: distinguishing n work profile apps? Did you know that if you have 3 work profiles and an app only installed in the 3rd one, it will always show \"3rd Work [whatever]\" (even though it\u0027s the only one)?\n\n(Also note that I only list 3 strings here, but the system will just uses the 3rd string for anything higher-numbered, at least if that\u0027s all we give it.)",
