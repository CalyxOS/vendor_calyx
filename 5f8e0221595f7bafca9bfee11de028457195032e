I really didn\u0027t want a helper script, but there\u0027s just no way to do what we need in the Android Init Language otherwise, apart from just giving up to a worse user experience... unless there is some other way to get USB devices connected properly without consulting the type-C role and acting conditionally, but I\u0027m not aware of one.",

Set Restrict USB to deny new devices.\n3. Disconnect the flash drive.\n4. Set Restrict USB to allow new devices.\n5. Plug in to a computer.\n6. The device is not detected.\n7. Unplug and plug in to a computer.\n8. The device is still not detected.\n\nOr, wherever it says flash drive and computer, reverse it. Same issue.",
